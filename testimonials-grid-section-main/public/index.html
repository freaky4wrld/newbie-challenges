          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects
          I learned were current, if not more so, in the company
          I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
           I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
           people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the 
           free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
           The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
           Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,
           working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”
