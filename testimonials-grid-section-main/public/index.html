          “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
           I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
           people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the 
           free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
           The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life.
           Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers,
           working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

          “ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
          could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
          100% recommend! ”
